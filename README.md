# JanusGraph-Python
## Python Client drivers for [JanusGraph](http://janusgraph.org) 

JanusGraph-Python is the Python drivers for connecting to JanusGraph. 
It extends Apache TinkerPopâ„¢'s [Gremlin-Python](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#_gremlin_python) 
as its core dependency with additional support for JanusGraph-specific types and predicates.

### Pre-Requisites

The library has been tested with following Python versions:

- [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-340/).
- [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/).
- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/).
    
Once the required Python version is installed on system, please note the version number and the Python added 
to Path. Make a note of the number, as that will be required during building of Library (on UNIX)
Try running either of following commands on CLI, and make a note of the version which works:

- python3 --version
- python3.4 --version
- python3.5 --version
- python3.6 --version

**NOTE**: The above checks aren't needed if installing the drivers from PyPi

### Building Library

You can build the library yourself to test out the functionality of library. Refer to 
[Building docs](BUILDING.md) for documentation on how to build the library.

### Installing the Library

- Though Installation of library is built as a functionality of the automated build scripts provided,
  but if needed, user can follow the bellow instructions to install the library to environment of their choice.

- To install library using Pip (It is not yet hosted):
    ```bash
    # X is version number of JanusGraph Python client supported based on JanusGraph version chosen.
    pip install janusgraph_python=X
    ```

- To install library from tarball, once it is built:
     ```bash
     pip install target/dist/janusgraph_python/dist/janusgraph_python-X.tar.gz
     # X is version number of JanusGraph Python client supported based on JanusGraph version chosen.
     ```

### Compatibility Matrix

| JanusGraph Version | Client Version |
|:------------------:|:--------------:|
| 0.3.0              | 0.1.0          |
| 0.3.1              | 0.1.0          |
| 0.2.x              | Not Released   |

The JanusGraph client follows x.y.z version number, and according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) 
z is patch number. Hence, if a client is build using x.y against JanusGraph a.b.c, 
irrespective of `.z` change, the client will remain compatible.

Example::
    ```bash
    Version 1.0.0 is compatible with JanusGraph 0.3.0. Meaning that 1.0.1/1.0.2/..1.0.x will all be compatible with
    JanusGraph 0.3.0
    ```
